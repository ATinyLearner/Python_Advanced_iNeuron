    "### 1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "Ans: Abstract superclass is a class where there is no direct use of that class for creating instance.But it is mainly used for using that class as inheritance. Also abstract class should have atleast one abstract method. It is super class as other class inherits this class."

User can modify the permission of that variable in the class which is not possible inside a function."
